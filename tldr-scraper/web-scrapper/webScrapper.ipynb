The new model will likely be a multimodel large language model with similar capabilities to GPT-4, but better.

Other issues, besides those that may come up from testing, may delay the launch.',\n",

The patient, a 29-year-old man named Nolan Arbaugh who is paralyzed from the neck down, is able to control a cursor on a screen using Neuralink's device. He is able to play games online for about eight hours before the implant needs to recharge. Arbaugh reports that his experience with the implant has so far been positive, despite some initial issues.

A new explanation for the phenomenon of aging called the 'information theory' postulates that aging is mainly driven by the loss of epigenetic information and that cells can be reprogrammed into behaving like their younger selves by reverting them to their pluripotent states. While the theory offers a path to reversing aging, there are still many challenges to overcome before the technology can be used - errors made while reprogramming cells can result in cancer and other major complications.\",\n",

A new explanation for the phenomenon of aging called the 'information theory' postulates that aging is mainly driven by the loss of epigenetic information and that cells can be reprogrammed into behaving like their younger selves by reverting them to their pluripotent states. While the theory offers a path to reversing aging, there are still many challenges to overcome before the technology can be used - errors made while reprogramming cells can result in cancer and other major complications.\n",

While the theory offers a path to reversing aging, there are still many challenges to overcome before the technology can be used - errors made while reprogramming cells can result in cancer and other major complications.\\\",\\\"date\\\":\\\"2024-03-21\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"future\\\",\\\"newsletter\\\":\\\"tech\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":596768,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://github.com/getgrit/gritql?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"GritQL (GitHub Repo)\\\",\\\"tldr\\\":\\\"GritQL is a declarative query language for searching and modifying source code.
