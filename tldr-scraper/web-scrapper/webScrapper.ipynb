       "[\"Apple is reportedly actively negotiating with Google to bring Gemini's generative AI technology to iOS. The company is aiming to release AI features to customers later this year. These features will likely be powered by a mix of first- and third-party AI models. While Apple has been testing its own in-house models, its AI tech is said to be less advanced than the competition.\",\n",
       " \"Nvidia announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models during its developer's conference on Monday. The new Blackwell AI graphics processors are expected to ship later this year. NIM is a software that makes it easier to deploy AI. Nvidia aims to make all models runnable with all of its GPUs through NIM. NIM will make it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, allowing companies to continue using the GPUs they already own.\",\n",
       " \"The Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel features a pair of 123-feet-tall solid 'wings' on top of its deck to harness wind power for propulsion assistance. After six months of operation, results from its journeys show that the technology offers a promising way to reduce existing vessels' emissions. The ship reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day - it saved over 12 tons a day during optimal weather conditions. One potential issue with the adoption of the technology is the extra 125 feet of height added by the wings as they could complicate docking in many locations.\",\n",

However, the nature of work will change and the tools the industry uses may be very different from what it uses now.

The Vision Pro is effectively a very polished prototype or a developer kit rather than a consumer product. While it is an impressive piece of technology, there's not much that people can do with it. The future of computing probably isn't more or bigger screens. It may take a few years before the technology really takes off.\",\n",

A single cow can produce enough milk every day to supply thousands of type 1 diabetes patients with their daily insulin for an entire month. Scaling up production, ensuring the health and welfare of the transgenic cows, and navigating regulatory approvals are still huge challenges that lie ahead before the process can replace conventional methods of insulin production.\n",

This is when an engineer who has been senior for too long finds themselves between two worlds upon their next job search: they are too senior to be hired as a senior or they have too little leadership experience to be hired in a leadership position.
